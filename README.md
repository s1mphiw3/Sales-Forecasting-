# Sales-Forecasting
**Overview**
This repository contains a machine learning model for forecasting sales at a grocery store. The model utilizes historical sales data to predict future demand for various products. This information can be used to optimize inventory management, improve pricing strategies, and make informed business decisions.

**Features**

**_Data Preprocessing:_**
Data cleaning and handling missing values.
Feature engineering (e.g., creating time-based features, handling seasonality).
Data scaling and normalization.
**_Model Training:_**
Implementation of various forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM).
Model selection and hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)).
**_Prediction Generation:_**
Generate sales forecasts for specified time horizons.
Visualizations of forecasted sales trends.
